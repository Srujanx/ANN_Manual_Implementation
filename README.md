# ANN_Manual_Implementation
mplemented forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent manually using only NumPy. Designed a 2-layer neural network from the ground up â€”defining weights, biases, activation functions, and cost calculations explicitly.Verified every computation step with pen-and-paper derivations to confirm my Python implementation matched the theory.
